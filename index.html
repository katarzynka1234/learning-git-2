		    <h1> All in all</h1>
			<h2>lifehouse</h2>
		    <p> 
			Standing on top of the edge, it feels like it's going down
			Everything stays in my mind, feeling in a daze on the ground
			Feels like it's gonna give, life's too hard to live anymore
			I think I've had enough things too tough
			I'm out the door <br>

			ref.
			All in all it's just another day now
			You're falling down
			What you gonna do
			Standing on top of the world tonight
			No one's looking back at you...
			Stand tall
			It's going on
			It's going on
			It's gonna be just fine
			You're holding on
			Holding on today... <br>

			Things don't stop and the others announced they're moving on
			Salt and tears in the minds, in the mouths of a bad decision
			Too late for another mistake, it's bringing me down
			With all your faults, it isn't your fault
			What's going on <br>

			ref.

			So you lost yourself
			So you lost your way
			Found life through someone else
			But you threw it all away <br>

			ref.

			Time's rolling on
			Rolling on today
			It's going on
			Going on today</p>

		    <h1> Anchor </h1>
		    <h2> Lifhouse </h2>
		    <p> I stand with a blank expression now
			and I can't believe myself
			will someone tell me how
			did I get here
			I am walking
			changing slowly
			I am chasing
			climbing closer <br>

			I know that I'll never be alone
			you will never let me go
			you are my anchor
			hold my hand
			while I'm sinking in the sand
			no one else could understand
			you are my anchor <br>

			it seems that I lost track of time
			and I can't believe my mind
			would you save me if
			I reached out to you
			I'm WAITING, watching, standing
			I am reaching
			climbing closer <br>

			I know that I'll never be alone
			you will never let me go
			you are my anchor
			hold my hand
			while I'm sinking in the sand
			no one else could understand
			you are my anchor yeah
			anchor yeah anchor yeah </p>

			<p>I am walking
			changing slowly
			I am chasing
			climbing closer <br>
			I know that I'll never be alone
			you will never let me go
			you are my anchor
			hold my hand
			while I'm sinking in the sand
			no one else could understand
			you are my anchor yeah
			anchor yeah
			anchor yeah <br>
			can you hear me
			hear me
			can you hear me </p>
