    <h1> All in all</h1>
	<h2>lifehouse</h2>
    <p>" Tekst piosenki:

Standing on top of the edge, it feels like it's going down
Everything stays in my mind, feeling in a daze on the ground
Feels like it's gonna give, life's too hard to live anymore
I think I've had enough things too tough
I'm out the door

ref.
All in all it's just another day now
You're falling down
What you gonna do
Standing on top of the world tonight
No one's looking back at you...
Stand tall
It's going on
It's going on
It's gonna be just fine
You're holding on
Holding on today...

Things don't stop and the others announced they're moving on
Salt and tears in the minds, in the mouths of a bad decision
Too late for another mistake, it's bringing me down
With all your faults, it isn't your fault
What's going on

ref.

So you lost yourself
So you lost your way
Found life through someone else
But you threw it all away

ref.

Time's rolling on
Rolling on today
It's going on
Going on today"</p>
	    <h1> Lifehouse - Anchor </h1>
	    <p> I stand with a blank expression now
and I can't believe myself
will someone tell me how
did I get here
I am walking
changing slowly
I am chasing
climbing closer

I know that I'll never be alone
you will never let me go
you are my anchor
hold my hand
while I'm sinking in the sand
no one else could understand
you are my anchor

it seems that I lost track of time
and I can't believe my mind
would you save me if
I reached out to you
I'm WAITING, watching, standing
I am reaching
climbing closer

I know that I'll never be alone
you will never let me go
you are my anchor
hold my hand
while I'm sinking in the sand
no one else could understand
you are my anchor yeah
anchor yeah
		    anchor yeah </p>
